# **Employee Burnout Analysis and Prediction**  

### **Internship Project Overview**  
As part of my internship, I spearheaded the analysis and prediction of employee burnout using a dataset of 22,750 records. This project showcased my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and provided actionable recommendations to improve employee well-being.

### **Key Objectives**  
1. **Analyze Burnout Drivers**: Pinpoint critical factors such as mental fatigue, workload, and organizational setup contributing to burnout.  
2. **Uncover Trends**: Reveal insights into the impact of work-from-home setups, job roles, and company types on stress levels.  
3. **Enable Early Intervention**: Lay the groundwork for predictive modeling to preempt burnout.

### **Detailed Insights**  

#### **1. Key Correlations**  
- **Mental Fatigue Score and Burn Rate (0.878)**:  
  Employees with higher mental fatigue tend to have significantly higher burnout rates. This indicates that addressing mental fatigue can directly lower burnout risk.  
- **Resource Allocation and Burn Rate (0.811)**:  
  Workload (measured by resource allocation) strongly correlates with burnout. Overworked employees are more likely to experience burnout.  
- **Designation and Burn Rate (0.719)**:  
  Burnout rates vary across job roles, reflecting differences in responsibilities and stress levels associated with various designations.

#### **2. Work-from-Home Impact**  
- Employees without access to work-from-home (WFH) setups exhibit higher burnout rates compared to those with WFH availability. This suggests that flexible work options can reduce stress.

#### **3. Gender-Based Insights**  
- Burnout rates show variations by gender, with trends indicating that stress levels differ based on workplace dynamics and societal expectations.  
- Male and female employees may experience different challenges, which organizations should consider in their policies.

#### **4. Company Type (Product vs. Service)**  
- **Service Companies**: Showed higher burnout rates, likely due to client-facing roles and tight deadlines.  
- **Product Companies**: Exhibited relatively lower burnout, indicating a potential advantage of project-based work over service-based work.

#### **5. Role of Designation**  
- Higher-level designations correlate with elevated burnout rates. Senior roles with greater responsibility often face higher stress.  
- Entry-level roles, while less demanding, also report burnout, possibly due to adaptation challenges or unclear expectations.

#### **6. Workload Analysis (Resource Allocation)**  
- Burnout increases as workload (resource allocation) rises. Employees assigned higher workloads (scores 7–10) are at greater risk.  
- Efficient distribution of tasks can mitigate stress and improve productivity.

#### **7. Distributions of Key Metrics**  
- **Burn Rate Distribution**:  
  The majority of employees fall into moderate burnout levels (around 0.4–0.6 on a scale of 0–1). A smaller segment experiences extreme burnout (above 0.8).  
- **Mental Fatigue Score Distribution**:  
  A similar pattern is observed, where most employees report moderate fatigue levels, but a critical subset shows alarmingly high scores.

#### **8. Visual Insights**  
- **Heatmap Analysis**:  
  Strong correlations between burnout-related metrics emphasize the interplay of mental fatigue, workload, and job roles.  
- **Histograms and Count Plots**:  
  Clear visual trends for categorical variables like gender, company type, and WFH availability provide actionable insights for HR interventions.

### **Recommendations**  

#### **1. Flexible Work Policies**  
Provide WFH setups to employees in high-stress roles to offer flexibility and improve work-life balance.

#### **2. Task Redistribution**  
Optimize resource allocation to prevent workload overload. Ensure an equitable distribution of tasks across teams.

#### **3. Role-Specific Stress Management**  
Develop tailored stress management programs for high-burnout designations, focusing on reducing role-specific challenges.

#### **4. Gender-Sensitive Policies**  
Address unique stress factors faced by male and female employees, ensuring an inclusive and supportive work environment.

#### **5. Mentorship Programs**  
Implement mentorship and training for new joiners to ease their adaptation to the workplace and clarify expectations.

#### **6. Targeted Interventions**  
Focus on employees with high mental fatigue scores, offering counseling and wellness programs to proactively address burnout risks.
